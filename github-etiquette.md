Keep file paths short and sensible.
Don't use funky characters and spaces in your file names, these cause trouble because of differences in Mac/Windows systems.
Always pull before you push in case someone has done any work since the last time you pulled - you wouldn't want anyone's work to get lost or to have to resolve many coding conflicts.
